      "\n",
      "### Objective:\n",
      "Identify genes that regulate T cell exhaustion by measuring differential TCR signaling responses between acute and chronic stimulation conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Features:\n",
      "- **Balanced gene selection** across 4 major functional categories\n",
      "- **High-priority targets** based on literature evidence and therapeutic relevance\n",
      "- **Expected differential effects** between acute vs chronic conditions\n",
      "- **Multiple readouts** for comprehensive phenotyping\n",
      "\n",
      "### Stimulation Conditions:\n",
      "- **Acute**: IL-2 only (maintains survival without exhaustion)\n",
      "- **Chronic**: Anti-CD3 + IL-2 (induces exhaustion through chronic TCR stimulation)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Primary Readouts:\n",
      "1. **TCR signaling strength**: Phospho-flow cytometry (pZAP70, pERK, pS6)\n",
      "2. **Exhaustion markers**: PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3 surface expression\n",
      "3. **Functional capacity**: Cytokine production (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2)\n",
      "4. **Transcriptional state**: RNA-seq for exhaustion gene signatures\n",
      "\n",
      "### Expected Outcomes:\n",
      "- **Checkpoint inhibitors** (PDCD1, HAVCR2, LAG3): KO should enhance signaling in chronic condition\n",
      "- **Exhaustion TFs** (TOX, EOMES, BATF): KO should reduce exhaustion phenotype\n",
      "- **Metabolic regulators** (MTOR, HIF1A, MYC): Context-dependent effects on sustained signaling\n",
      "- **TCR components** (LCK, ZAP70, LAT): Proportional effects on signaling strength\n",
      "\n",
      "### sgRNA Design Recommendations:\n",
      "- Use 3-4 sgRNAs per gene for redundancy\n",
      "- Include non-targeting controls and positive controls (TOX, PDCD1)\n",
      "- Target early exons for effective knockouts\n",
      "- Use established design tools (Broad GPP portal, CHOPCHOP)\n",
